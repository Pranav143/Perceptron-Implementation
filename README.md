# Perceptron-Implementation
Implementing a single neuron from scratch in Python. 
This is a quick and easy exercise to ensure a firm understanding of the lower level inner workings of a simple neural network. The task ahead is to train a single neuron to recognize an 'X' pattern in a 3x3 square. 
The input is in the form of an array of 9 integers, either 1 or 0. A (1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1) input corresponds to an 'X' shape as visualized below:

                                                         1 | 0 | 1
                                                         0 | 1 | 0
                                                         1 | 0 | 1

While this is a trivial task in Python, using a single neuron for this task proves to be an effective exercise in understanding the mechanisms behind concepts such as gradient descent, backpropogation, activation and loss functions, and learning curves. 
No libararies beyond basic math and data structure manipulating ones are used.
